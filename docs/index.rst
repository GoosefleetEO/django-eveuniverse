*django-eveuniverse* is a foundation app meant to help speed up the development of Eve Online apps with Django and ESI. It provides all classic "static" Eve classes as Django models, including all relationships, ready to be used in your project.

Furthermore, all Eve models have an on-demand loading mechanism for fetching new objects from ESI.
